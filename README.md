#SpeechTest 

#A java program that plays sound-files from the sound catalogue. The purpose with the program is to present word or sentence lists and score in the gui. Text-files with the correct words/sentences can be stored together with the speech material.
#The source code includes a speech-in-noise mixer but that part is commented out in this version. Speech-in-noise is however a feature that should be added. 
#Usage: Compile and make a jar-file. Add speech material in the Sound folder. Push play.
